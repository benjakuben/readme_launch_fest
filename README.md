ReadMe (Launch Festival 2013 - Treehouse)
==================

This is a very simple social bookmarking app written to demonstrate the usefulness of popular open source libraries including:

- ActionBarSherlock
- RoboGuice
- SmartImageView
- PullToRefresh

The back-end is written with parse.com. You must include ActionBarSherlock and PullToRefresh as library projects for this code to compile.
